### âœ¨ Hello! I'm Anna Clarke âœ¨
I am currently a student at Epicodus, a coding bootcamp. I spend 90% of my time pair programming and scrolling documentation. I'm currently learning C# and .NET, but excited to start React in a few weeks!

#### Technical Skills
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* Python
* C#

#### About me
I've tried many different hats (veterinary school, nanny, speculative fiction writer, illustrator...) before stumbling across computer programming at the beginning of 2021. I'm hooked! I love moss covered trees, solving puzzles, and crochet.
